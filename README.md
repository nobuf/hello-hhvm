This is going to be a project for learning HHVM/Hack.

```shell
mkdir hello-hhvm
cd hello-hhvm

docker run --name=hello-hhvm \
	-v $(pwd):/var/www \
	-p 12345:80 \
	hhvm/hhvm-proxygen:latest

mkdir public
touch public/index.php
atom .
open http://localhost:12345/
```

Apparently there's no update since "[Hack Language Support in PhpStorm Postponed](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2015/06/hack-language-support-in-phpstorm-postponed/)" was announced on June, 2015. [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/docs/quick-start/getting-started/) looks like a natural choice of editor.

This move sounds a bit tricky for a small organization.

Let's see if I'd face any compatibility issue.

```shell
composer require slim/slim "^3.0"
```

Edit `index.php` and it seems Slim's Hello World is working well. Note that `composer` was installed separately to the host environment, macOS, in my case.



Nuclide's "Go to Declaration" does nothing out of the box.

```shell
brew tap hhvm/hhvm
brew install hhvm
hh_client
```

> For example, if you want to go to the definition of `getPages()`, hover over `getPages()` and either press `Cmd-<mouse click>` or `Cmd-Option-Enter` (`Ctrl-Alt-Enter` on Linux).

OK, for some reason it's not `Option-Command-â†“`. Plus, you probably need to restart Atom/Nuclide.



I just realized that maybe I should have used the below command from the beginning:

```shell
composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton hello-hhvm
```

```shell
composer test
```

All green. Well, this is using php7 on macOS though.

```shell
docker-compose up
curl -v http://localhost:8080/
curl -v http://localhost:8080/nobuf
```

Alright, it's working!

```shell
hhvm -v Eval.Jit=false vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Without option, phpunit runs painfully slow.

[Documentation has a section](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/tools/hackificator) for `hackificator`, but apparently `brew` [doesn't include this tool](https://github.com/hhvm/homebrew-hhvm/issues/19).
